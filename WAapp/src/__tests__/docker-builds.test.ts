 * The current implementation is a synchronous stub that always returns
 * `{ success: true }`. Replace with real build logic (for example, invoking
 * the Docker CLI or Docker Engine API) to perform an actual build.

 * - `success`: `true` if the image push succeeded, otherwise `false`.

 * @example
 * const result = pushDockerImage();

 * Replace this placeholder with an implementation that performs the actual
 * Docker push (e.g., invoking Docker CLI or SDK) and returns appropriate
 * status and error information.
