# DEPRECATED: This workflow is redundant with deploy-pages.yml
# 
# RECOMMENDATION: Delete this file and use deploy-pages.yml instead
# 
# Reasons for deprecation:
# 1. deploy-pages.yml covers the same functionality
# 2. deploy-pages.yml has better configuration (workflow_dispatch, concurrency control)
# 3. deploy-pages.yml uses GITHUB_TOKEN instead of custom PAT
# 4. Maintaining two similar workflows causes confusion
#
# If you need this workflow for a specific reason, here's the optimized version:

name: Build and Deploy (Legacy)

  push:
    branches: ['replit-agent']
  workflow_dispatch:

# Prevent concurrent deployments
concurrency:
