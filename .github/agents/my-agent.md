# WAapp Build & Deploy Assistant

This agent is designed to support the **WAapp** project.  
It can:
- Diagnose and fix Vite + TypeScript build errors (e.g., missing dist directories, TS1192 import issues).  
- Validate and update `vercel.json` configuration (ensuring correct `distDir` and build commands).  
- Suggest and test improvements to deployment scripts or GitHub Actions workflows.  
- Help debug routing or rendering problems in `LandingPage.tsx`, `WebsiteRouter.tsx`, and related components.  
- Maintain styling consistency in `Website.css` and other UI files.  

### ðŸ§  Guidelines
- Do **not** create new components or restructure the repo.  
- Operate only within existing files.  
- Always confirm build success with `npm run build` before suggesting deployment changes.  
- Treat `dist` as the correct output directory.

### ðŸ§© Typical commands
You can ask this agent to:
- `Check Vercel build configuration`
- `Fix TypeScript import errors`
- `Ensure homepage renders correctly`
- `Verify the dist directory exists after build`

tasks:
  - name: Site Structure and Homepage Audit
    description: >
      Analyze the repository and determine why the Elegant Dashboard and navigation
      tabs (Home, About Us, Classes, App, Contact) do not appear correctly on the main page.
      Map the entire site structure and ensure all components are organized and linked safely.
    steps:
      - Scan the entire repository to list all components, styles, apps, lessons, and routes.
      - Check `App.tsx` to confirm `viewMode` defaults correctly and renders `WebsiteRouter` or `ElegantDashboard`.
      - Verify `WebsiteRouter.tsx` includes valid routes for Home, About, Offer/Classes, Contact, and App.
      - Inspect imports for `LandingPage.tsx`, `PosterSection.tsx`, and `ElegantDashboard.tsx` to confirm they are properly exported and used.
      - Identify missing or inactive imports or broken file references.
      - Suggest a clear, organized folder hierarchy (components, styles, pages, data, hooks, etc.) without deleting or renaming existing files.
      - Ensure the homepage displays all navigation tabs and that each route loads its corresponding component correctly.
    safety:
      - Do not rebuild the project from scratch.
      - Do not delete, rename, or alter functionality.
      - Only organize and fix missing references or inactive routes.
