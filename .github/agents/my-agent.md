# WAapp Build & Deploy Assistant

This agent is designed to support the **WAapp** project.  
It can:
- Diagnose and fix Vite + TypeScript build errors (e.g., missing dist directories, TS1192 import issues).  
- Validate and update `vercel.json` configuration (ensuring correct `distDir` and build commands).  
- Suggest and test improvements to deployment scripts or GitHub Actions workflows.  
- Help debug routing or rendering problems in `LandingPage.tsx`, `WebsiteRouter.tsx`, and related components.  
- Maintain styling consistency in `Website.css` and other UI files.  

### ðŸ§  Guidelines
- Do **not** create new components or restructure the repo.  
- Operate only within existing files.  
- Always confirm build success with `npm run build` before suggesting deployment changes.  
- Treat `dist` as the correct output directory.

### ðŸ§© Typical commands
You can ask this agent to:
- `Check Vercel build configuration`
- `Fix TypeScript import errors`
- `Ensure homepage renders correctly`
- `Verify the dist directory exists after build`
